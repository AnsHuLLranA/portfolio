💻 With a background in [hey, i am student of chandigarh university], I've honed my skills in front-end and back-end development, ensuring that every project I work on is not just functional but also visually stunning.

🚀 Collaboration is key to my process. I love working with teams to brainstorm ideas, solve problems, and deliver results that exceed expectations. I'm committed to continuous improvement, constantly seeking out ways to enhance my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
